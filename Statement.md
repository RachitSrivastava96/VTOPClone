# Problem statement

VTOPClone aims to recreate the core behavior of an institutional student portal (VTOP) in a self-contained, developer-friendly environment. 
The problem it addresses is twofold:

- **For students**: there is no lightweight sandbox where they can explore a portal-like interface without using live university systems, risking real data or depending on institutional infrastructure.
- **For developers/learners**: there is a lack of small, realistic Django projects that demonstrate how to combine authentication, session security, credential management, and interactive dashboard widgets (like to-do lists and dynamic sidebars) in a clean, understandable codebase.

By implementing a simplified but faithful clone of a real-world portal, VTOPClone provides a realistic reference for:
- Modeling student-related data and auto-generated credentials.
- Handling authenticated user flows (login, logout, timeouts).
- Organizing templates, static assets, and JavaScript into a coherent, portal-style UI.

# Scope of the project

The scope is intentionally focused so that the project is achievable, understandable, and extensible:

- **Core student portal flows**:
  - Django-based web application with student login and logout.
  - Authenticated dashboard acting as the central hub for navigation.
  - Profile display, digital ID card, and a dedicated page for viewing autogenerated WiFi credentials and Library ID.
- **Task management**:
  - A to-do list component on the dashboard that supports creation, listing, toggling completion, and deletion of tasks.
  - All task operations are exposed via JSON endpoints and are scoped to the currently logged-in user.
- **Technology stack boundaries**:
  - SQLite is used for local data persistence to keep setup simple and zero-config.
  - Django templates, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript are used for UI and behavior, avoiding heavy frontend frameworks.
  - Static assets (CSS/JS/images) are organized under `core/static/core/` for clarity.
- **Out-of-scope items** (deliberately excluded to keep the project focused and safe for local experimentation):
  - Production-ready deployment hardening (reverse proxies, load balancing, container orchestration).
  - Integration with external identity providers (SSO, OAuth, etc.).
  - Real payment gateways or financial transaction processing.
  - High-availability, multi-tenant, or sharded architectures.

This scope makes VTOPClone ideal as a teaching, demo, or experimentation project rather than a production-grade portal.

# Target users

VTOPClone is designed for several distinct audiences, each with different goals:

- **Students / learners**:
  - Explore how a typical university portal feels and behaves without needing access to the real system.
  - Understand the relationship between login, sessions, dashboards, and personal data like credentials and ID cards.
- **Django beginners and intermediate developers**:
  - Study a concrete example of a multi-page, authenticated Django app with real-world UX patterns (sidebar navigation, dropdowns, dark mode, widgets).
  - Learn how to structure apps, templates, static files, and URL routing for a medium-sized project.
  - Use the project as a base to add more features (grades, registrations, payments, etc.) as exercises.
- **Instructors and trainers**:
  - Use VTOPClone as a lab or assignment base to teach authentication, model design, REST-like endpoints, and frontend integration.
  - Demonstrate common patterns such as auto-generating related records (e.g., `StudentCredentials` when a user is created).
- **Administrators / testers (in a development context)**:
  - Leverage Django’s admin site to manage users, credentials, and to-do items during demos or testing.
  - Quickly reset or reseed the database in classroom or workshop environments.

# High-level features

At a functional level, VTOPClone provides a curated set of features that mirror the essentials of a real portal:

- **Authentication & sessions**:
  - Login and logout using Django’s built-in authentication system.
  - Session timeout behavior (e.g., around 20 minutes of inactivity) to approximate institutional security policies.
  - Protection of sensitive views (dashboard, profile, credentials, to-do APIs) behind authentication checks.
- **Student-facing dashboard**:
  - Personalized greeting and quick access tiles (e.g., courses, exams, grades, payments).
  - A collapsible sidebar with grouped sections like My Info, Academics, Research, Examination, Services, and more.
  - Dark mode toggle and live clock implemented via JavaScript for a modern user experience.
- **To-Do list API and UI**:
  - Endpoints for adding, listing, toggling, and deleting tasks for the logged-in user.
  - A responsive widget on the dashboard that consumes these endpoints and updates the UI dynamically.
- **Automatic credential generation**:
  - `StudentCredentials` objects are automatically created when new users are added.
  - Each credential record includes WiFi username/password and a formatted Library ID (`LIB#####`), showing how derived data can be generated from core user information.
- **Identity views (Profile & ID card)**:
  - Profile page displaying user-related information in a layout reminiscent of institutional portals.
  - ID card view that formats user data as a digital badge suitable for on-screen reference or printing.
- **Static assets and templates**:
  - Structured organization of CSS, JavaScript, and images to keep portal styling maintainable.
  - Django templates that separate layout (`base.html`) from content pages (dashboard, login, profile, ID card, credentials).
- **Admin integration**:
  - Use of Django’s admin interface for browsing and managing users, to-do items, and `StudentCredentials`.
  - Convenient for debugging, demos, and quick data edits without building custom back-office screens.
