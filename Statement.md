# Problem statement

VTOPClone replicates core features of an online student portal (VTOP) to give students a single, web-based interface for accessing academic-related services and personal information. The project addresses the lack of a lightweight, self-contained educational portal for local use and testing that demonstrates authentication, credential management, and simple task management.

# Scope of the project

- Implement a Django-based web application providing student login, dashboard, profile display, digital ID card, and management/viewing of autogenerated student credentials (WiFi username/password and Library ID).
- Provide a simple To-Do list with create, toggle, and delete operations exposed via JSON endpoints for the authenticated user.
- Use SQLite for local data persistence, Django templates for UI, and static assets for styling and client-side behavior.
- Exclude production deployment hardening, external identity providers, payment integrations, and high-availability requirements.

# Target users

- Students who want a consolidated view of personal academic services and credentials.
- Developers and instructors who need a small, local Django project to study, demo, or extend portal-like functionality.
- Administrators using Django's admin site for basic user and data management during development.

# High-level features

- User authentication and session handling (login, logout, session timeout behavior).
- Student dashboard showing user-specific information.
- To-Do list API and UI (add, list, toggle completion, delete) scoped to each authenticated user.
- Automatic generation of `StudentCredentials` on user creation (WiFi username/password and Library ID).
- Profile and ID card views rendering user information.
- Static asset organization (CSS/JS/images) and Django template-based UI.
- Basic admin integration via Django admin for managing users and models.
